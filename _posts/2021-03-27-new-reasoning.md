Originally I was going to write this post somewhere in 2020, but I've needlessly delayed that due to bikeshedding: I've tried to write my blog in Rust + Actix-web thinking I could hit two birds with one stone (but got demoralized because it was an overengineered project), I've wasted time on the CSS (designed the site CSS-first and got frustrated due to indecisiveness and lack of artistic talent). In the end I've decided to stop putting the cart before the horse, and actually write my posts.

This article is a rambling about my poor life choices after graduating college, as well as describing what burnout can look like. I doubt this article is of any use to anyone else, but it is of use to me as it provides some closure for this chapter of my life; It's a way of consolidation what I've learned from the past two years and move on.

# A ride... downward

Both 2019 and 2020 have been... confusing on a personal level. As a result of not knowing what I truly seek in a CS career, I've made a series of choices that in retrospect were really bad for me. I've experienced severe burnout twice, without knowing in prior what burnout actually was, and that forced me to quit my master's programme, and later my job. I've been unemployed since the start of 2021, which has given me breathing room to think and explore broader topics, kind of like a sabbatical.

At my graduation in the summer of 2019, I felt... nothing. I couldn't be cheerful because I had a lingering feeling that I haven't learned enough, and there was still so much to learn. For some this was an end of a chapter in their lives, however what I personally felt was that this was but a footnote. Internally, I reasoned that the IT sector might not remain so profitable in the future, so my way of surviving was to prioritize knowledge acquisition over momentary profit. The conclusion would seem pretty obvious at this point: follow a master's instead of joining the workforce, and worry later. However, there are a couple of factors that complicated my decision process:

- Local (Romanian) master's programme aren't really a full-time endeavor
I read about this on a blog. Basically, there's a sharp discrepancy between local and western universities (think Cambridge,MIT,etc.) regarding the time you have to put in. My local master's programme kind of expect that you're going to be working part-time, and thus have lighter requirements regarding assignments, grading, and participation. The blog even stated that it would be a waste of time to dedicate yourself only to the master's programme. High-profile foreign universities are a lot more demanding, and it's not recommended to work part-time.

- I wasn't sure if I had more to learn from industry, or from college
There are some things that you learn only after you join the industry, just as there are things that you only have the opportunity to learn in college. I bounced ideas with my family a couple of times on this, and my opinion regarding this matter shifted a couple of times from one extreme to the other. In the end I concluded that both play a role.

In the end, I wound up choosing something in-between: do both a master's, and work a part-time job. In addition to that, I'd also continue being a TA, because I liked that role. The job I'd do would be at the same firm as my summer placement, so I didn't have to worry about prospecting jobs. Now, here is the part where, in retrospect, I've royally screwed myself:

```
I picked the hardest programme available: AI. And I'm a systems kind of guy.
```

My reasoning was that if most master's programmes are lukewarm, then why not pick the one from which I could learn the most? Maybe I could cross-pollenate ideas from AI with systems programming. That prospect seemed interesting, plus the firm at which I worked part-time was in the image-recognition business. So, win-win? wrong...

Firstly, I really didn't like AI at all, and it took me a while to realize that. I should have had a pretty good guess that I didn't, since my experience with my diploma project (a research topic that personally felt soul-crushing, relied heavily on a paper by google, and with which I barely scratched the surface) wasn't that great, however I dismissed that as my blunder since the was topic was niche and picked by me. At a conscious level I thought that I like AI, but deep within the unconscious I liked systems programming, not AI. This added to my cognitive dissonance.

Secondly, the AI programme is the one that barely lets you get away with working part-time. In addition to that, I was TA-ing two bachelor modules. This resulted in me underperforming in all 3 areas (job, TA, master's) due to lack of time: some days I'd leave at 7AM and get back at 7PM, and I didn't even realize I was working myself to the bone until a roommate pointed that out. And he was right. With this schedule, weekends were "homework days", and I barely had time for anything. I'd often find myself staring at the screen in my room, knowing I had homework to do, yet being absolutely unable to start. I'd stare at the screen with my editor opened for hours and not be able to press the keys. I was stunned because I didn't know what was wrong with me (spoiler: it was burnout). I'd emotionally bully myself, but only get weak results. Add that to the cognitive dissonance.

Thirdly, the **level of dedication shown by the teachers was _lower_ than that of the bachelor's programme**, which was very disappointing. I was expecting the exact opposite. I felt pretty let-down, because I was striving to do the best at the laboratory, but my extra effort compared to my peers felt wasted effort as I wasn't appreciated or rewarded for it. Some modules had semi-mandatory participation and were unbearably monotonous to the point that I actually felt I could learn more on my own rather than from those dictations. This really made me question if following the master is worth it at all. Why not follow some Coursera courses or whatever in my spare time instead of pretending I'm progressing? Add that to the cognitive dissonance.

The breaking point was the winter break at the end of 2019: at that point I've amassed a debt of a couple of homeworks and many incomplete lab assignments. I knew that by working everyday of the 3 week "vacation", I'd be able to recuperate. I still had that mindset of "bullying" myself into progressing. What happened in reality was my strongest escapist episode of my life: I binged anime and tv-shows for 2 weeks straight. Nothing else. I'd wake up, watch some isekai anime on my laptop, occasionally eat, then go to sleep. By the start of the third week I knew something must be wrong, and came to the conclusion that I should just quit my master's. It wasn't going to work. I stopped showing up in 2020 (except for TA-ing, I actually cared about that more than the other 2), and for a while I felt relieved. I switched to full-time at my job, and that was that.

## Second burnout

Throughout 2020 things were going pretty well. However, as time passed I came to see that I was doing a lot of python scripting, and started to remember my original creed: _"Prioritize learning over monetary gain"_. At that point I started to feel like I wasn't learning enough. So I've started learning in my free time, which worked for a while. I even gave up TA-ing in order to be more dedicated to learning in my spare time. However, something was amiss. At the end of the workday I'd have very little energy left in me to dedicate to something else. If I pushed myself to work on something, I'd underperform the next day. It felt like a curse.

Another source of frustration came from the fact that I had (and still have) this great idea for an "open source project that could turn startup" that I felt like I had to pursue, but couldn't due to lack of free time.

Around the same time in 2020 I realized I burnt out again. Unlike the last time, I recognized that it was burnout, however I failed to predict its onset. I announced my resignation quite abruptly, on a Friday, two weeks before the winter holidays. I'm thankful that the team understood my motives (they also had ambitions around my age that they regret they didn't pursue), and wished me good luck.

# Morals and closing thoughts

**Try to match the difficulty with your proficiency level**. This is a mistake I've made throughout my life, even realized it a couple of times, but I've never felt I've taken action to combat this. Basically I'd pick the hardest tasks thinking that I'd learn the most that way. I'd often implode from the difficulty and just give up. Feeling that the work is hard does not mean that it's also optimal.

**Do you value depth-first or breath-first learning**? Many aspects of life can be placed on a scale with 2 extremities. Learning is no exception. All this time I've been seeking out depth-first avenues, however I came to realize that what I truly desire is a breath-first experience, at least for the time being. This was another source of internal frustration to which I've been completely oblivious to.

**Find out what you _want_ to do**. To do that, you must quite literally hang out with yourself. I feel like we fail to notice that many interactions we can have with others are actually reflexive: they can be applied to the self. Hearing yourself out is very important in order to figure out where you are in life and what path is the best to follow. You can also be fully honest without repercussions!

I think I failed miserably in this department because modern technology has created an environment where it's always so easy to fill your time with... anything really: another scroll on Facebook or Reddit, another YouTube video, or Netflix. Even the commute to work can now be filled with an audiobook! We _unconsciously devoid ourselves of any time to introspect about our lives_, and we end up in messy psychological states.

**Use the carrot, not the stick**. This kind of ties in to the previous point. Bullying yourself into completing your assignments will work in the short-term, but it's neither sustainable or healthy. Try to find a narrative of compassion. If you can't, then maybe you're not doing the right thing and need to reevaluate, like I should've.

**Always bounce ideas for long-term plans with a body of people as diverse as possible**. I feel like most of my mistakes could have been prevented, had I consulted with more friends, classmates, even the teachers! My deeply introverted nature discouraged me from doing that.

**Life is a marathon, not a sprint**. I've had this idea in my head, planted by media and motivational speakers, that I could overcome heavy workloads if I believed in myself, and that I could grow a lot from that. But, as Nietzche stated in "He who has a why can muster any how", I was lacking deep down a "why". On a conscious level I believed that's what I desired, but on a subconscious level the opposite was true, which made me crumble. I've also tried to bite more than I could chew. I was thinking only of the short term gains, but failing to acknowledge the unsustainability in the long term. At least I learned first-hand what burnout is.

I feel pretty dumbfounded regarding my current position. I feel like I've wasted 2 years for no good reason. If I could rewind time I'd choose differently, but unfortunately my choices have been committed and I can't `git push --force` 😥. Anyhow, as that saying goes, "When you hit rock bottom, the only way left to go is up". Well, truth be told, my situation is not that dramatic, but the takeaway is the same: the only way I can move now is forward.
