This is a list of tools I've made that can run in the browser. They're either written in javascript or compiled to webassembly.

{% for tool in site.toolbox %}
    <h3><a href="{{ tool.url }}">{{ tool.title }}</a></h3>
    {% if tool.description %}
    {{ tool.description }}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
