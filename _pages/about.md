## I'm Nick, and this is my own little corner of the internet.

I've graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science. I tend to like low level languages the most, maninly because they are the closest to the hardware. Topics such as privacy, security, open-source intrigue me.

Other than computers, I'm also interested in cooking and east asian culture. I'm biased towards Japan since it has a larger media export.

This blog-thingy has a target audience of exactly one person - myself. If you're reading this then congratulations! You made my effort of writing these ramblings a little more meaningful. That, or you're one of those scraper bots. Anyhow, the reason I'm not actively seeking an audience is because I'm setting the bar for myself so low that I can't fail. This blog could run unread by others for it's entire lifetime and I'd be perfectly OK with that, because at least I learnt something while building it, and chiseled some of my beliefs while filling it. If others read it and find value in what I write here, then... that's just a bonus.
