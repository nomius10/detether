## I'm Nick, and this is my own little corner of the internet.

I've graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science. I tend to like low level languages the most, mainly because they are the closest to the hardware. Topics such as privacy, security, open-source intrigue me.

My purpose in writing this blog is to consolidate thoughts/ideas/experiments, all in an easy-to-share manner.
